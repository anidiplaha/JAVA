# JAVA LinkedList
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. 
The important points about Java LinkedList are:

Fetures Of Linked List
Java LinkedList class can contain duplicate elements.
Java LinkedList class maintains insertion order.
Java LinkedList class is non synchronized.
In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to occur.
Java LinkedList class can be used as a list, stack or queue.

Types Of Linked List:
1. Singly Linked List:-
It is the simplest type of linked list in which every node contains some data and a pointer to the next node of the same data type. 

2. Doubly Linked List:-
A doubly linked list or a two-way linked list is a more complex type of linked list that contains a pointer to the next as well as the previous node in sequence. 

3. Circular Linked List:-
A circular linked list is that in which the last node contains the pointer to the first node of the list. 

4. Doubly Circular linked list:-
A Doubly Circular linked list or a circular two-way linked list is a more complex type of linked list that contains a pointer to the next as well as the previous node in the sequence. The difference between the doubly linked and circular doubly list is the same as that between a singly linked list and a circular linked list. The circular doubly linked list does not contain null in the previous field of the first node.

5. Header Linked List:- 
A header linked list is a special type of linked list that contains a header node at the beginning of the list. 

Multiply Linked List:-
Multiply Linked List is a data structure in which each node of the list contains multiple pointers. It is a type of linked list which has multiple linked lists in one list. Each node has multiple pointers which can point to different nodes in the list and can also point to nodes outside the list. The data stored in a Multiply Linked List can be easily accessed and modified, making it a very efficient data structure. 
The nodes in a Multiply Linked List can be accessed in any order, making it suitable for applications such as graphs, trees, and cyclic lists.
